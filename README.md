This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.


Animated background was inspired by the color changing animation in https://github.com/scso-ucsc/Incremental-Game-Development 
Button outline inspired by the gradient buttons in https://ishachury20.github.io/cmpm-121-demo-1/

Thank you to both of these people for giving me inspiration to improve my game!
